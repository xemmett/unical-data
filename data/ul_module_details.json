The Ogham Stone is already an important publication in the context of student-produced journals, and is increasingly recognized as a serious publishing option for both well-known and emerging authors wishing to reach new audiences. The module's blend of practical and theoretical concerns ensures that students gain transferable skills, and many students in English and Creative Writing ultimately pursue careers in editing and publishing. This module offers a collaborative enterprise within the structure of both MA programmes in which experience can be gleaned with such vocations in mind. Moreover the module will further the applied experience of students in the examination, assessment and analysis of literary texts. They will develop a sense of the practical difficulties and possibilities involved in the process of editing a literary journal, and in so doing they will add a clear vocational dimension to their literary studies in a collaborative, team-oriented publishing venture. In this and its companion module students are asked to conceptualize, plan and deliver the new issue of The Ogham Stone, working on it from submission stage to publication.

Students will be expected to market the journal using existing social media platforms and other outlets, raising awareness of the journal by circulating the Call for Submissions and liaising with the media; they will also conduct a review of the finances and initiate a project management plan. Students will manage communications with authors and artists, and will organise submissions so that the editorial process can run smoothly and efficiently. Students will also make decisions about the extent and nature of editorial intervention, producing a stylesheet and a set of guiding principles.

Further topics include an understanding the physical education curriculum within the (Irish) school system and what is worth learning.

The student teacher will explore their role as facilitators of learning through the preparation of a safe, scholarly, creative and inclusive learning environment. They will also explore their role as members of a professional school community.

It provides an opportunity for faculty and tutors to mentor student's in the context of the school setting, to appraise their suitability to become effective teachers and to evaluate the appropriateness of their planning, teaching and learning strategies and their capacity to reflect, draw insights from and research their teaching.

Students are also introduced to the distinctions between microeconomics vs macroeconomics and normative vs positive economics.\r\nMarkets as a means of organising economic activity are examined.  The model of supply and demand is used to understand how market equilibrium prices and quantities are determined.  You not only learn how equilibrium is determined, but how relative prices are used by consumers and suppliers to make decisions about the use of societys scarce resources.  Supply and demand curves are used to explain the movements of prices and the allocation of resources in a market economy such as ours.  Government intervention in the market via the introduction of price ceilings (maximum price) and price floors (minimum price) are also examined.\r\nThe sensitivity of demand and supply to changes in key variables such as price and income is analysed through measures of elasticity.\r\nIndividual decisions are looked at in detail to show how they come together to form the demand curve.  Consumer choice using indifference curve analysis is introduced.\r\nShifting the focus back to the market process the latter part of the module focuses its attention on supply and costs of production.  Students examine the different types of costs and how costs affect revenue and profits.\r\nCost concepts and how they relate to a perfectly competitive firms supply decision are examined.  At the other end of the competitive spectrum is the complete absence of market competition.

It is a revised and updated module which covers the period of the Revival but also broadens the canon. It will introduce students to a range of Irish literary work and cultural movements in the period 1880-1930. It aims to introduce students to selected literature from this revolutionary period in Irish culture, attending to innovations in style, structure, and genre in the period, and concentrating on formal as well as cultural experimentation.\n\nBackground: from the 1880s on, the 'Irish Question' was a central site of struggle in British and Irish public discourse, and in this turbulent period a new generation of writers began to interact with this and other questions in their literary work. Writers such as W. B. Yeats, J. M. Synge, Lady Gregory, George Moore, and Eva Gore-Booth identified (temporarily, in some cases) with cultural nationalism, and became associated with the Irish Literary Revival and cultural arenas including the Abbey Theatre and the Gaelic League. Decadent and 'New Woman' writers Oscar Wilde, George Egerton, and Sarah Grand, resisted hegemonies of a different kind, subverting gender and sexual identities and challenging prescribed roles in the family. Against the backdrop of an emerging socialist movement, writers such as G. B. Shaw and Se\u00e1n O'Casey, tackled class activism; while others, including Anna Parnell, Roger Casement, Ernie O'Malley, and Maud Gonne began to write autobiographical accounts of their involvement in Irish national struggles. Over the course of this period, the work of James Joyce began to draw on these radical discourses and other transnational literary movements in the production of his important literary experiments.", "syllabus": "Exploring selected Irish writers and literary movements 1880-1930, this module aims to introduce learners to one of the most radical periods in Irish culture.
