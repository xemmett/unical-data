Skills such as evidence-based\nreasoning and problem-solving in STEM-related issues are essential for STEM\ngraduates and the general public alike. Inquiry underpins how STEM professionals\nseek to understand problems and questions related to the universe, the material \nas well as the natural world. For example, scientists inquire about what causes\nclimate change and in addressing such a problem, they collect data to derive such\nconclusions. Argumentation, the process of coordination of evidence and theory in\nin order to justify knowledge claims, is central to how STEM knowledge is \ngenerated, evaluated and validated. Inquiry is thus the broader mechanism of how \nSTEM disciplines operate whereas argumentation focuses on the particular ways in\nwhich STEM knowledge is produced and justified. Many societal problems are also \nunderpinned by a range of issues that rely on the use of inquiry, evidence and \njustification.

Case studies are and have been used to a large extent in academic disciplines for decades such as business, law and medicine.  \nThe case method of teaching has a long history within business schools particularly, with it being used at leading universities such as Harvard for over 50 years (Gomes &  Knowles, 2000).   The case method was pioneered in Harvard Business School where executives would bring to classes actual business problems and were then asked to write analyses and recommendations for the business dilemma (Erskine et al., 1981;13).  Some international business schools use the case method exclusively in their master's degree programmes.  Academics have discussed the use and management of case studies in the pedagogy of business courses for decades.  The case study method has evolved into a pedagogy that enriches the learning experience for students. \nCases give students an opportunity to apply theoretical constructs and coursework to real business problems. The case method is seen to more accurately reflect the realities of the workplace than other pedagogies (Rogers &  Rymer, 1998).  \nCritical thinking is a core-learning outcome for university teaching to achieve.  Case studies endeavour to get students to distinguish between assumptions and facts, getting students to think through rationally about a problem, evaluate both quantitative and qualitative evidence and how they would overcome a similar decision situation drawing on previous classwork. \nThrough the use of cases students are better able to apply, analyse, synthesise, and evaluate information, helping them make informed decisions.  \nThe case method is utilised in this module, for the following purposes;\n1. To understand the current issues and trends affecting marketing, consumption and society. \n2. To examine the typical activities, opportunities, and challenges, facing professionals involved in marketing. \n3. To confront the complexities of real marketing situations. \n4. To relate theory to practice and assist the long-term retention of that understanding of marketing.", "syllabus": "This module uses the case study method and computerised simulations as the primary pedagogic devices to assess and learn from factual scenarios centred on; market orientation; assessing marketing opportunities; formulating and executing marketing strategy; enhancing marketing analysis and decision-making; brand/product management; competitive analysis, dynamics, and rivalry; marketing programme development; fmcg marketing; service marketing; public sector marketing.

We critically analyse the advantages and limitations of the Covariance VaR method.

Motor cognition is the field of research concerned with understanding action. It differs from traditional approaches by considering imagery, observation and movement all worthy of study from one perspective. Sport, where movement expertise is at a premium, offers a naturalistic laboratory for examining issues within the field of motor cognition. The unique perspective of motor cognition will employ a strong theoretical and research base and will illuminate the complex interaction between cognition and action. Theories range from Jeannerod's theory of motor imagery, which led to the genesis of this the motor cognition paradigm, to mirror-neuron hypothesis and contemporary accounts of expertise. The module takes the theoretical knowledge forward into application across the domains of skill acquisition, skill maintenance and expert performance. Quantification in the measurement of key constructs employing both qualitative and quantitative approaches (e.g., neuroimaging) is explored.

If they choose to they can write autobiographically. In week three, working from these profiles, we will begin exploring in detail how we might enrich them and develop them into fuller biographical treatments. An initial exercise in will be the construction of a timeline. Subsequent sessions will consider the organisational methods and writing techniques needed for making a story out of as life as well equipping students with the skills, insights and awareness they will need to find and then use the information they will need.  We will consider interviewing and subsequent analysis of transcripts as well as the location and interpretation of sources that can provide insights into our subject's interior world or that can project their personality.

The second year practicum experience serves to bridge the gap between the theory of learning and professional knowledge and the field experience.  This is enhanced through an educative and pedagogical cycle of learning that includes planning, action, reflection and dialogue with, among others, two teaching practice tutors. The student teacher will explore their role as facilitators of learning through the preparation of a safe and scholarly learning environment. They will also explore their role as members of a professional school community through understanding the requirements of planning, implementation, assessment and evaluation in the management of teaching and learning with particular reference to this experience of School Placement Practice. It aims to develop confidence in self-appraisal and their ability to reflect on their own planning and performance. It seeks to develop the skills necessary for effective classroom management, preparation of effective teaching resources and personal professional development.\n\nThis module commences with learning activities in advance of the placement involving lectures and seminars to assist the students in preparing for their practice.  These seminars employ a range of evidence-based approaches to enable students to experience a variety of pedagogical strategies.  For example, the use of case-based learning is used to provide opportunities for students to explore classroom scenarios from various perspectives.  Exploring evidence-based teaching and learning strategies is a core focus of the pre-school placement seminar activities and therefore the module draws strongly on various meta-analysis studies of effective pedagogies to identify best practice. Where possible the module also aims to draw on contemporary research from Irish post-primary classrooms that deal with issues such as assessment, differentiation of learning and classroom management.  The module is also informed by policy initiatives and changes that have direct implications for the professional practice of teachers. These include professional codes of conduct and legislation in relation to child welfare. The module aims to enable students to competently engage in the teaching process and take professional responsibility while on school placement.", "syllabus": "The modules provides an opportunity for faculty to tutor student's in the school setting, to appraise their suitability to become effective teachers and to evaluate the appropriateness of the students' planning and implementation. Reflective writings, planning and preparation and the layout of the School Placement File are laid out according to guidelines in the School Placement Handbook. The practicum has a number of visits between the school and university and with the teaching practice tutors. For example, Pre Teaching Practice visit to school; pre Teaching Practice tutorial with tutors; preparatory planning; school placement with induction period; tutorial and assessment visits; post School Placement tutorial.   \n\nAs part of the pre-placement activities, students are provided with an introduction to the complexities of teaching to help students fulfil their role as facilitators of learning drawing upon Evidence Based Practice; Teacher as Researcher; Pedagogical Strategies; Classroom Management; Assessment for/of learning; benefits and limitations of using statistical analysis strategies to determine the effectiveness of pedagogical approaches. The preparatory elements of this module will help students to understand schools and the dominant teaching approaches that are used within them by looking at the history of Irish post-primary schools - educational provision in modern Ireland (school type; patronage/governance). The concept of the reflective practitioner will be central to this module where students will be given an introduction to the knowledge, skills and practices of reflection. The module examines the requirements of the Teaching Council and other bodies in relation to professional conduct, and child welfare issues.", "learning_outcomes": "As part of the preparatory seminars and lectures students will:\n\nEvaluate key factors which influence teaching, learning and assessment in Irish post-primary schools drawing from research in the area of effective teaching and learning\n \nIdentify effective classroom management skills and evaluate appropriate pedagogical strategies for classroom management\n  \nOutline the Teaching Council Code of Professional Conduct and its relevance to professional practice\n\nDifferentiate between assessment for and assessment of learning within the context of your professional practice\n \nDiscuss the complexity of issues surrounding child protection and welfare in schools\n\nSelect an artefact for inclusion in students' Portfolio\n\nAt the end of the module student teachers will have developed expertise in designing and implementing valid learning outcomes and experiences appropriate to specific teaching situations in post primary schools. Students will use a process and product approach to planning that will generate schemes of work for each class grouping, lesson plans for each lesson. There will be coherence between the learning outcomes, the organisation of the learning environment and assessment. All learning outcomes listed will seek to move from lower order to higher order cognitive knowledge. Students will have developed the ability and confidence to reflect on their planning and performance in the light of education theory.", "affective": "At the end of the module student teachers will appreciate the importance of contextual factors in the planning and practice of teaching.

The philosophy underpinning this approach was to introduce students to real data, which was entirely absent from Leaving Certificate mathematics in the 1990s, and begin to lay the foundations for the elements of data modelling necessary for the years three and four modules in the statistics options. Probability and Statistics account for 20% of the new Project Maths syllabus. Students now entering first year have had  prior exposure to elementary data handling skills and experience applying the some basic ideas of probability. Consequently, it is not obvious that it is still necessary or desirable to adopt a teaching approach that separates the subject areas statistics and probability. As things stand, probability is totally absent from MS4212. One consequence of this omission is that statistical tools are  introduced without proper formal theoretical justification based on probability models. Likewise, students are not as well prepared as they could be for the (rather packed) follow-on module MS4213. The intention in the revised (and renamed) first year introductory module is to include some probability in the syllabus. The strategy is to give students time to explore some of the many classical/famous problems that often arise in introductory probability. Discrete random variables and probability mass functions will be covered. As well as relieving some of the pressure in the congested semester 3 module MS4213, students will now be required to engage in more algebraic manipulation and basic mathematics.

Yet, changes in the nature and technology of media have altered the ways in which crime is portrayed and challenge conventional wisdom and prior accounts of the crime-media relationship.

First, how has is crime used in popular media and how, if at all, has this changed over time? Second, how are crime stories selected for media presentation? What are the social and institutional processes that drive selection? What types of crime are deemed most suitable for re-telling in popular media? How is this related to the specific methods and modalities of different media platforms? Third, how do specific media platforms tell crime stories in unique ways that may shape how they are interpreted, understood, and ultimately experienced by audiences. Here, specific attention focuses on reality TV, podcasting, and the emergence of \"docudrama\" or \"infotainment\" programming (e.g., Netflix). Finally, how do crime stories reflect and reinforce social - cultural, political, and even economic - features of societies? In other words, how do crime stories in the new era of mass media influence how people and social groups think, feel, act, and interact with others in light of experiences with true crime mass media? In answering these questions, the module seeks a broad interrogation of how and why societies use crime in popular culture.
